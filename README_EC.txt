Program description:
This program takes in "inputList.txt" which has a bunch of information about books and then stores 
that information for each book in an object of class Book and then stores all the books in an object 
of class BookList. 

The list can be searched for book information by name, book information by ID, and find all books by an author. 

Outside help: 
I used the same resource I used in the main part of the lab to help with reading files since that isnt something ive done before. 
I used this link I used https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/ref_fstream_fstream.asp 

How to run: 
Run the following commands in the correct directory that the .cpp and .txt files are located
$ g++ 7755662598ExtraCredit.cpp -o extracredit.out 
$ ./extracredit.out
